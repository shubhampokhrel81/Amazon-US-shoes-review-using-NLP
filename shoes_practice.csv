I realize that twenty-four hours does not seem to be adequate time to determine whether or not these shoes are effective, but I am satisfied. They are well-made, conforming to shape of the foot, especially near the ankle. This is something I find to be important in searching for a good walking or running shoe. There is a lot of cushion and the sturdy shape of the shoe forces the feet to land in proper alignment. With the proper alignment of the feet and the fit of the shoe, I have noticed that my muscles are being used more efficiently. If you would a nice shoe with a true-to-form fit and great cushion, I recommend these shoes. I especially recommend the Oyster.. color, it looks nice with jeans and can be dressed-down for a simple workout. Also, my mother, who has surgically-repaired feet, has a pair of these shoes she doesn't need to wear her orthotics with them.

I eventually got used to the feel and continued to wear them, as they were quite comfortable.

My first reaction when I got the shoes was that they were very light, at first you kind of have to break them in. They may seem a bit snug and may hurt a little bit. Perhaps it hurted me more than others because I have flat feet. After a week when you break them in, they sort of shape to your feet. It will feel comfortable and you'll feel as light as a feather, the shoes are great for athletics and they are very aesthetically pleasing, more so I liked how the shoe was rather versatile. If I wanted to wear some chinos, or some casual wear it wouldn't look to bad infact it would play the part. what I absolutely loved about these sneakers is how you can simply slip them on, I always hated those sneakers that you had to untie and worry about the shoe getting creases and what not. I however found that after a while, the shoe felt like it was slipping off and that it may have expanded during the time I was wearing, again nothing too big but it felt like it grew about 1/2 over the time I had it.  This became my go to shoe whenever I was leaving, I didn't even dare look at the others as my feet had gone through so much uncomfort when I went back. The shoe can get rather slippery in the winter and on wet areas so you need to be careful there but it's not like they're meant to be used during the winter. One of the things that I disliked about the shoe is how I had to keep on tying the laces several times, perhaps this had to with the laces mainly but I felt like it was the shoe moving from place to place as it started to expand and stretch. During the shoes last dying dies, I start to get holes from the ongoing times I've worn it, I knew it wouldn't last the way I treated it but for $40+ I didn't very much care. I later discovered that the inside of the shoes is composed of mainly some kind of cardboard, kind of surprising how such a comfortable fit could be made from such cheap material.<br /><br />I would recommend these to a friend, perhaps you may not want to wear them as much as I did however if you plan on making them last but it's great and with a price like that. You can't really go wrong. Would I buy them again however, there are many other shoes in the market and I'm willing to try many and see where they take me but I will have flashbacks of all the events that I had with my pair of shoes. I never begun to adore a shoe like that, no matter how much damage and dirt and stretching it went through, it managed and still had an amazing authentic look.""",b'2013-11-02',b'Wore them over a thousand times',b'R2BW2D703FSDV0',5,1,0,1

My last pair of boots were a 8W (I have wide feet), the pair before were an 8.5B.  I ended up buying the 8B of these and was pleasantly surprised they fit well. I did go to a local Justin distributer to try on boots, but they didn't carry any steel-toe, so I tried on some others to get a feel for Justin sizing--the 8.5 was way too big so I went with the 8B. I also checked the various sellers on Amazon that sold these boots and found one that had free shipping BOTH ways, just in case (paid $5 more for the boots, but well worth it). Glad I didn't need it.  These boots are: ASTM F2413-11 F/I/75 C/75 EH. All the references on line (including Justin's website) listed them with the previous ASTM reference and I couldn't find the other details anywere.  Only drawback I see is the bottoms are farily smooth. I have not had slipping problems yet, but I usually buy boots with more of a rugged bottom, so hopefully I still like them in a few months!  Update: I wear these everyday for work 8-10 hours a day. The soles have worn completely smooth and the heel is quite worn down in 18 months. My company only pays for boots every 24 months, so I won't be buying them again.

I tried the size 8 but it was a bit too long but still narrow and was loose under the toe strap.  My biggest complaint is that the foot pad is harder than my other FitFlops so it doesn't give the same arch support.  I like the footpad that has both a horizontal and vertical impression in the toe pad (original fit?) while the newer styles have a single arc impression in the toe pad.  The single arc style runs shorter and narrower than the original fit but is probably is true to size in length.  I have heel pain so the harder footpad doesn't work for me.

I was looking at these kind of flips because it is said that the regular ones are bad for you with their thin sole. One other plus for me was the big toe cover. Maybe I don't pick up my feet high enough in flips but I have a tendency to stub my toe so this works for me. I think it looks ok but many might not. These are sporty anyway not like a sexy sandal or on trend havaianas. Still a great deal.<br /><br />Update:<br />I have worn nothing but these all summer. Total and thorough abuse.

So, I gave it to her for Christmas and she proudly took it on her Christmas airplane trip to visit her Grandma.  It turned out to be a hit, because she used it as a small piece of luggage to hold her trip toys, books, sweater, etc.  Otherwise, it would not be suitable for using as a &#34;purse&#34; for a child, and probably the design would not suit a lady, for whom the size would be well-suited.

It was better quality than I expected frankly from Adidas.  The boots are a lightweight material that appears to breathe easily, and the boots themselves are very light  The two comments I would offer that might help others are 1. Order at least a half size larger.  These were slightly tight in width and length compared to half a dozen other similar boots I have bought  2.  The lace system is a little different.  One side of the lace is more or less permanently threaded through the top lace holder while the other side slides in and out so you can unloop the lace to open the boot to put it on or take if off.  The challenge is that I sometimes like to leave them unlaced at top for casual activities and you really cant do that with these, and getting them on and off with the lace system is a little unusual.<br /><br />But for price if you are looking for lightweight gore tex boots these are as good as any.'",b'2015-01-26',b'Nice lightweight approach boot',b'ROBCZ4VLK0ANK',4,8,0,1

I ordered the largest size I could find (18-24 mo. when she was in a size 7-8). They slip on quite easily, and stay put.  Many of the shoes for girls are Mary Jane style, so they don't have that front covering, but although this pair has the look of a Mary Jane, it has that white leather covering the front, keeping them on! The flower is so cute, and helps distinguish left from right (unlike some soft shoes which are the same for both feet). This is even more important for my daughter because if she interchanges the shoes, they both end up taking the shape of her &#34;normal&#34; foot, making it look like she has two left feet! :-)<br /><br />These shoes are not warm--just normal leather, so they won't keep feet warm, just protected.<br /><br />The leather on Robeez is durable--usually these are for pre-walkers or toddlers, who aren't as hard on their shoes and aren't wearing them on wet pavement; these have held up in all sorts of weather conditions.  Be aware that the leather will harden if they get wet. But for my daughter this just sort of &#34;seasoned&#34; them for her. As baby shoes they will stay soft and supple.  I have wiped them off with a dilution of Simple Green sprayed on a clean white cloth and have had good success removing normal dirt.<br /><br />The colors are great, but will wear (scratch off) if worn roughly (as my daughter does, since the toe often gets caught and turns under on her &#34;little foot.&#34;) This shouldn't be a problem for babies/toddlers.<br /><br />The elastic around the ankle has never once broken on a single pair of Robeez we have had (we have bought several pairs as she has grown). This is the first place she will outgrow the shoe though--not the length.  As her ankles get bigger (she is thin), the elastic will become too tight and stretch to the limit.  When I purchased this style (Flower Soft Sole Slip On), I got her one pair in the 18-24 month to fit her normal foot, and one in the 0-6 month to fit her little foot.  While the foot fit, the elastic was too tight around the ankle and she was not able to wear the smaller shoe. If your baby has chubby ankles, keep an eye on how tight these are around the ankle.<br /><br />I definitely recommend Robeez as durable baby/toddler shoes, and as an option for children with limb differences.  These have been a life-saver for us.  Not sure what we are going to do now that she is outgrowing them, other than enforce compliance with wearing the prosthesis!!the limit.

They are super cute *and* comfortable, which is quite uncommon to find both qualities in a pair of shoes.  The heel is very thick and not super high, which makes them easy to walk around in and still feel stable.  I am a city dweller and spend a lot of time walking around during my commute, and these boots were comfortable from day 1.<br /><br />My only confusion was on day 0, when I actually received the boots.  I read all of the reviews on Amazon and it sounded like collectively, these boots were going to be true to size.  I am a solid size 6, with moderately wide feet, so I ordered my usual size 6.  When I got the boots, I was convinced that they were too small.  The back of the heel felt very stiff and I thought the ball of the foot felt tight as well.  I was positive that I was going to get blisters on the back of my heel and on the inside ball of my foot.  I was super bummed because they were so cute, so I immediately ordered a 6.5 and waited for those to arrive.<br /><br />When the 6.5 arrived, the length felt very spacious, so I was no longer worried about the back of my heel.  However, the arch of the boot was definitely hitting the wrong spot on my foot, making my feet hurt just after a few steps.  So the 6.5 definitely were a no-go.<br /><br />I really, really wanted to keep these shoes because they were so adorable!  So I tried on the 6 one more time ... and they fit perfectly!!  I was so perplexed.  I don't know if they magically stretched out while sitting on my floor for a couple days or what, but the length suddenly felt fine, and the ball area didn't feel tight at all.<br /><br />I have no idea why I thought they were too small at first, but I wasn't going to press my luck.  I wore the size 6 the very next day, all day, and even played on stage in a rock show standing in these boots, and they were perfect!  No problems!  No blisters!  Love.  These will for sure be a footwear staple for me.<br /><br />Side note, these are my secondpair of OTBT shoes, my first pair being a pair of OTBT flats, which I also found extremely comfortable.""",b'2013-10-02',b'Cute and comfortable!',b'R11S415FAX47I3',5,0,0,1

I have noticed that they are a little hard on the sole which is one reason why I'm giving them 4 stars, but that could be fixed with a shoe insert.<br />The other reason I gave them 4 stars is because the shoe is a little tight, I ordered my normal size and even with regular socks it's a little snug.

The strap of the purse is adjustable and I made it long enough so that I could carry it over my shoulder and across my body. Only 2 suggestions for improvement:  the width of the purse strap- I thought it could have been a quarter of an inch wider just to make it feel a little more solid, and an exterior pocket for a water bottle.

Reviews that say \\\\""Out of the box impression is great\\\\""...tells me nothing. So I have waited until I\'ve had good use with these before I\'ve rated these boots.<br /><br />I bought these because my brother and Uncle both have them and said they wear great. Maybe I didn\'t get a good pair. While I\'ve had them about 8 months, I\'m certainly not impressed with the wear that I see with them. I am a general contractor, one day I may be installing new water lines under a house, the next building a deck or installing tile or roofing. Now, I know that with what I do, I don\'t expect my shoes to wear as well as someone else\'s.<br /><br />The bad: okay the first thing to happen, and albeit not terrible, was the right shoe string broke within the first month, again not a big deal but annoying on a new pair of boots. Next, the sole has started to pull away from the leather body on both shoes, worse on the right starting on the inside about the middle of the arch around the front to almost the heal on the outside. This is on both pair, not as much on the left but still happening. Last item of concern is the stitching on the left toe has started to come apart. I realize again that I do spend time on the ground, toes getting worn in the dirt, but I have had Justin work boots doing the same work and have never had this issue. Thetoes are sewn, so a difference there I also realize, I still expected better.<br /><br />The good: The bottom of the boots are wearing great, awesome tread ware!! if the rest of the boot wore as well as that it would be a 5 star rating easily! Boots are comfortable to wear all day, not quite so much if on concrete, but still not bad. My heals are really the only thing that feels sore after a long day.<br /><br />Overall though, not impressed for $200.00!! For me it\'s hard to compare apples to apples when I\'ve never wore a boot like this before. Only boot I can compare is Justins. The last pair of work wear I had were Merrels, half the price of what I paid for these and lasted a year.<br /><br />I know several people who wear these and like them, but maybe these aren\'t a good fit for construction. Or I\'m just extremely hard on boots.  Either way, I\'m not real impressed.<br /><br />Hope this helps.'",b'2013-04-08',b'Expected more',b'RFJUZA0THWLUW',1,3,0,1

They seem slightly narrower in the heel area to hold onto your foot, and wider and roomier in the front half of the shoe for more comfort and air circulation. They breath well even thought they are waterproof.  And the foam cushioning is superior to anything I\'ve experienced. Even after a day walking around on concrete, my feet aren\'t too fatigued (the rest of me is, however.)<br /><br />Imagine my surprise when I realized that boots I was forced to buy and never would have even looked at voluntarily are now my \\\\""new best favorites.\\\\""<br /><br />This experience may not be relevant to those doing really hard work in these boots, but for me, they\'ve been a Godsend.'",b'2012-07-27',b'More comfortable than I thought possible',b'R2SJ8ZXSXDAQUP',5,12,1,1

And, it did not pass my spin and slide test.  I tried it on both wood and tile.  I found that the sole was too grippy for most ZUMBA moves.

I have been buying this brand for over 20 years when I went to the local outlet and bought 12 pairs of shoes on sale.  I've been shopping at the outlets for 15 years.  They cracked, broke, peeled, and collapsed within less than a year. I was strolling though the mall when my heel just collapsed.  That's the only way to describe it.  It shattered before my eyes.  I vowed then never to purchase the brand again.  Instead, I ventured into the Marmi shoe store and purchased Vaneli flats to continue my shopping day.  When the Etiennes collapsed they were made of some sort of chalk type substance inside the sole and inside the heel.  Two pairs--heel dropped off, three pairs--shoe split in half horozontally, all peeled inside.  My feet do not sweat because I have poor circulation in the legs so that wasn't the cause.

They do offer good sun protection.  Of course they tint everything yellow, but that's to be expected.  The shading isn't dark, so they are easy to see with while wearing even if you go into a darker area.  The upside of that is that they look good at night and it's not at all hard to see at night with them on.<br /><br />One complaint though are the inside nose pieces.  They aren't that comfortable on a wide bridged nose and they aren't very adjustable, so they feel a bit uncomfortable.  They definitely stay in place though, and they don't slip down.<br /><br />Overall not a bad price for a pair of polarized sunglasses, if you like the look.
